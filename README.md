# Stardew Valley Farmhand Management
This utility is a stand alone save editor which allows users to add and manage more than four players in a multiplayer save file from Stardew Valley. No modifications or frameworks for Stardew Valley, such as SMAPI, are required for this functionality, and up to 8 players can be added to a vanilla multiplayer game.


# NOTICE
## This save editor is more than likely no longer stable as it was created before Stardew Valley 1.5. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
